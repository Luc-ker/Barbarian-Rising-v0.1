BOWLER,Bowler,DOUBLESTRIKE,[STRIKEOUT],[PHYSICAL:ICE],[GEO],3,false,This big blue dude digs the simple things in life - Dark Elixir drinks and throwing rocks. His massive boulders bounce off their targets and hit again behind it for a double strike!
ICEGOLEM,Ice Golem,FREEZEBLAST,[ICETOUCH],[FIRE:PHYSICAL:GEO],[ICE],3,false,The Ice Golem has a chilling personality and absolutely zero sense of humour. He frosts over everything he touches, freezes his surroundings when destroyed and ices up when talked to at a party.
